    Fittable is a flexible and easy-to-use software component optimized for handling large table structures with
    spreadsheet-like capabilities. Built using Angular and TypeScript, it offers a customizable table model, an
    interoperable operation execution mechanism and a dynamic user interface adaptable to model structure and changes.
