    Fittable is a powerful software component that provides advanced capabilities for managing large tables with
    spreadsheet-like functionality. Built using Angular and Typescript, it offers a dynamic table model, a robust
    operation execution mechanism, and a flexible user interface that can be easily customized to meet your specific
    needs.

    The main module of Fittable is developed in Angular, which provides a responsive and interactive view for the
    application. Meanwhile, the view model and other essential modules are written in Typescript, without any dependency
    on a GUI framework, making it possible to use the component on the server-side as well.
